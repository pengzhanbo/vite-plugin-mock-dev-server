# Introduce

`vite-plugin-mock-dev-server` is a plugin dedicated to providing mock services in the development environment of `Vite`.

It uses the built-in `http` and `http-proxy` services of Vite to intercept the proxy paths configured by `server.proxy` in a second level. When the rules are hit, it returns the mock data configured.

You can use any third-party module in the mock configuration file with `node`. This means that you can use libraries like `mockjs` / `faker-js` to help generate mock data.

The plugin supports responding to various data types including `text/json/Buffer/ReadStream`, and also supports setting headers, cookies, etc.

The plugin supports simulating `WebSocket`, making it easy to debug `WebSocket` services in a local development environment.

The plugin also supports simulating `Server-Sent Events`, making it easy to debug `EventSource` in a local development environment.
